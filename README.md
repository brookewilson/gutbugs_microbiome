This repository contains data processing script for the Gut Bugs Trial microbiome analysis. 

The Gut Bugs Trial was a double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial that assessed the efficacy of fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) to treat adolescent obesity and improve metabolism. The Gut Bugs Trial recruited 87 adolescents (aged 14-18 years) with a BMI >30 kg/m2 and randomised them 1:1 to receive a single dose of 28 FMT or placebo capsules. FMT capsules contained concentrated fecal material derived from 4 healthy same-sex lean donors (7 capsules per donor). Placebo capsules contained saline. Recipients were clinically assessed at baseline, and at 6-, 12-, and 26-weeks post-treatment. The primary objective was a change in BMI SDS at week 6. Secondary objectives included a variety of metabolic health parameters, body composition, and gut microbiome alterations. 

Donor and recipient stool samples collected at each clinical assessment underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. In total, 381 metagenomes were analysed.
